The program takes in the file sound.csv which contains sound recordings, as inputs. Principal 
Component Analysis was used to reduce the inputs to a single .csv file output.csv. The algorithm 
builds a covariance-variance matrix based on the inputs, and then determines the largest 
eigen-vector of that matrix. The corresponding eigen-vector, v, as the weights for the 
output. The output was determined by y = x1*v1 + x2v2, where x1 and x2 correspond to a set
of inputs. The termination condition was simply just one pass over the data to properly calculate the 
eigen value.
